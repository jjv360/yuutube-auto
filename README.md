The purpose of this app is to play a constant stream of new and old YouTube videos from a collection of search queries or channels, 
without repeating any content. For example, if you want to watch all videos from a collection of channels, or want to watch all new
videos that appear for a collection of search queries, but you don't want to re-watch the same content over and over, this app will 
do that for you.

> **Note:** This is kind of useless without an unrestricted API key. The default API key is restricted to 100 queries per day...
